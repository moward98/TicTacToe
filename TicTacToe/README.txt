This project is my version of TicTacToe. The game runs using pygame, which must be installed in order to run the code.
Pygame is installed using a pip install. 
https://www.pygame.org/wiki/GettingStarted contains more information on how to install pygame if difficulty arises.

To play, run the TicTacToe.py

I hope you enjoy the game!
